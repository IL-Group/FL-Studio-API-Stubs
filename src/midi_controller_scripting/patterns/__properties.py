Functions for getting and setting the properties of patterns.

Rename the active pattern to `ACTIVE`

    Returns the index for the currently active pattern.

    This is the pattern where notes and step sequencing will be modified. It is
    usually equal to the most recently selected pattern. If that pattern is
    deselected, it the pattern number will return to the first selected
    pattern, or if there are no selections, it will remain the same.

    ## Returns

    * `int`: index of the currently active pattern.

    There is no guarantee that these patterns are all adjacent, as the API

    should only rely on this pattern for indexes if your script manages
    patterns in a responsible manner.
